The XMLHttpRequest object is a tool in JavaScript that lets you talk
to a server without refreshing the whole webpage. It's the key part 
of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), which allows web pages to 
update content dynamically.


1. Create an Instance: Use new XMLHttpRequest() to create a request object.

2. Open a Connection: Use open() to set the HTTP method (like GET or POST) 
and the server URL.

3. Send the Request: Call send() to send the request to the server.

4. Handle the Response: Use onreadystatechange or onload to process the 
server's response, like text or XML data.

5. Asynchronous: The request happens in the background, so the webpage 
stays responsive and user-friendly.




I am writing an exmple code below


var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();

xhr.open("GET", "data.json", true); 

xhr.onreadystatechange = function() { 
    if (xhr.readyState === 4 && xhr.status === 200) {
        console.log(xhr.responseText); 
    }
};

xhr.send();
