Same-Origin Policy:
The same-origin policy is a security measure implemented by web browsers 
that restricts web pages from making requests to a domain different from 
the one that served the web page. This prevents malicious sites from 
accessing sensitive data on other domains.

Workarounds:

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing): The server can include specific HTTP 
headers (Access-Control-Allow-Origin) to allow cross-origin requests.
JSONP (JSON with Padding): A technique that allows cross-domain requests 
by adding a <script> tag to the page.

Proxy Servers: Use a server-side script on your own domain to fetch data 
from another domain and then serve it to the client.
