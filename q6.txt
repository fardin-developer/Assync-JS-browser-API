localStorage:

Purpose: Stores data on the client-side with no expiration time, meaning 
the data persists even after the browser is closed and reopened.

localStorage.setItem('username', 'JohnDoe');
var name = localStorage.getItem('username');
console.log(name); // Output: JohnDoe



Purpose: Stores data for the duration of the page session. Data is lost 
when the page is closed or refreshed.

sessionStorage.setItem('sessionID', 'abc123');
var sessionId = sessionStorage.getItem('sessionID');
console.log(sessionId); // Output: abc123
